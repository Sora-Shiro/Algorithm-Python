'''
"Fizz buzz" is a word game we will use to teach the robots about division. Let's learn computers.
You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:
"Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5;
"Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3;
"Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5;
The number as a string for other cases.
Input: A number as an integer.
Output: The answer as a string.
Precondition: 0 < number â‰¤ 1000
